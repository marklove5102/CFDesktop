 * exceptions occur.

/**
 * @brief  RAII scope guard for automatic cleanup operations.
 *
 * Executes a provided function upon destruction unless explicitly
 * dismissed. Useful for ensuring resources are released or
 * cleanup operations are performed when leaving a scope.
 *
 * @ingroup base_utilities
 *
 * @note    The guard is not movable or copyable. This design ensures
 *          cleanup operations are executed exactly once.
 *
 * @warning The stored function is invoked during destruction. Any
 *          exceptions thrown by the function propagate during
 *          stack unwinding.
 *
 * @code
 * {
 *     FILE* f = fopen("data.txt", "r");
 *     cf::ScopeGuard guard([&f]() { fclose(f); });
 *
 *     // Use the file...
 *     // File is closed automatically when leaving scope.
